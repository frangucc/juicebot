# SMC Confidence Scoring System
## World-Class Trading Agent - Pattern Detection & Prediction Tracking

### Overview
Adaptive pattern detection with confidence scoring (1-10 scale) that accounts for:
- Data quality (bar count, time coverage)
- Pattern characteristics (size, volume, recency)
- Market context (confluence, respect for technicals)

---

## 1. Confidence Scoring Framework

### FVG (Fair Value Gap) Confidence Factors
**Starting Score: 10.0**

Deductions:
- **Gap Size**:
  - < 0.2% of price: -3.0 (too small, noise)
  - 0.2-0.3%: -1.5 (marginal)
  - > 0.3%: No deduction (tradeable)

- **Age (Recency)**:
  - > 40 bars ago: -2.0 (stale)
  - 20-40 bars: -1.0 (aging)
  - < 20 bars: No deduction (fresh)

- **Volume Confirmation**:
  - Gap formed on <80% avg volume: -1.5 (weak)

- **Distance from Current Price**:
  - > 5% away: -2.0 (irrelevant)
  - 2-5%: -1.0 (distant)
  - < 2%: No deduction (actionable)

**Final Score**: max(1.0, calculated_score)

---

### BoS (Break of Structure) Confidence Factors
**Starting Score: 10.0**

Deductions:
- **Structure Significance**:
  - Break < 1% from swing: -2.0 (minor)
  - Break 1-2%: -1.0 (moderate)
  - Break > 2%: No deduction (major)

- **Volume Strength**:
  - Break on <100% avg volume: -2.5 (weak)
  - Break on 100-150%: -1.0 (normal)
  - Break on >150%: +1.0 bonus (strong confirmation)

- **Age**:
  - > 30 bars ago: -2.0
  - 15-30 bars: -1.0
  - < 15 bars: No deduction

- **Subsequent Price Action**:
  - Price retraced >50% of break: -2.0 (failed)
  - Price holding above/below: No deduction

**Additional Bonuses**:
- **Confluence with FVG**: +1.5
- **Multiple swings broken**: +1.0

---

### CHoCH (Change of Character) Confidence Factors
**Starting Score: 10.0**

Deductions:
- **Trend Strength Before Break**:
  - Weak trend (ranging): -2.0 (unreliable reversal signal)
  - Moderate trend: -1.0
  - Strong trend: No deduction (significant reversal)

- **Counter-trend Volume**:
  - <120% avg volume: -2.0 (weak reversal)
  - 120-150%: -1.0
  - >150%: No deduction

- **Multiple Timeframe Confirmation**:
  - No higher TF confirmation: -1.5
  - Higher TF agrees: +1.0 bonus

---

## 2. Data Quality Scoring

### Quality Score (1-10)
```
quality_score = min(10.0, total_bars / 20)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **1-3**: Very limited data (<60 bars). High risk, low probability.
- **4-6**: Moderate data (60-120 bars). Decent patterns visible.
- **7-8**: Good data (120-160 bars). Reliable pattern detection.
- **9-10**: Excellent data (180+ bars). High confidence analysis.

### Time Coverage
- 1-min bars: `time_coverage = bar_count` minutes
- Expected: 150+ bars for intraday = 2.5+ hours of price action

### Data Quality Warnings
LLM should communicate:
```
"‚ö†Ô∏è Limited data (50 bars = 50min). Risk higher, probabilities lower. Score: 3/10"
"‚úì Good data (180 bars = 3hrs). Patterns reliable. Score: 9/10"
```

---

## 3. Overall Pattern Confidence

### Combined Confidence
```
overall_confidence = (
    (data_quality_score + best_pattern_score) / 2
)
```

### Confluence Multiplier
When multiple patterns align:
```
if FVG + BoS at same price level:
    overall_confidence *= 1.2  # 20% boost

if FVG + BoS + Volume surge:
    overall_confidence *= 1.3  # 30% boost
```

### Example Output
```json
{
  "patterns": [
    {
      "type": "bullish FVG",
      "entry": 0.5670,
      "confidence": 8.5,
      "gap_pct": 0.45,
      "bars_ago": 12
    }
  ],
  "confluence": {
    "bos_nearby": true,
    "volume_confirmation": true,
    "confluence_score": 9.2
  },
  "data_quality": {
    "bars": 150,
    "quality_score": 7.5,
    "warning": null
  },
  "overall_confidence": 8.4,
  "probability_of_success": "70-75%"
}
```

## 4. Prediction Tracking Database

### Table: `trade_predictions`

```sql
CREATE TABLE trade_predictions (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    conversation_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id TEXT,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),

    -- LLM Prediction
    prediction_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'entry_suggestion', 'exit_suggestion', 'analysis'
    direction TEXT,  -- 'long', 'short', 'neutral'
    entry_price DECIMAL(10, 4),
    stop_loss DECIMAL(10, 4),
    take_profit DECIMAL(10, 4),
    risk_reward_ratio DECIMAL(5, 2),

    -- Pattern Data (JSON)
    patterns_detected JSONB,  -- FVG, BoS, CHoCH details

    -- Confidence Scores
    pattern_confidence DECIMAL(3, 1),  -- 1-10
    data_quality_score DECIMAL(3, 1),  -- 1-10
    overall_confidence DECIMAL(3, 1),  -- 1-10

    -- Market Context at Time of Prediction
    price_at_prediction DECIMAL(10, 4),
    volume_at_prediction BIGINT,
    bars_available INTEGER,

    -- Outcome Tracking (filled later by reinforcement learning)
    outcome_evaluated BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    outcome_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    price_movement_24h DECIMAL(5, 2),  -- % move in 24 bars
    max_favorable_excursion DECIMAL(5, 2),  -- MFE %
    max_adverse_excursion DECIMAL(5, 2),  -- MAE %
    hit_take_profit BOOLEAN,
    hit_stop_loss BOOLEAN,
    actual_outcome TEXT,  -- 'win', 'loss', 'breakeven', 'not_triggered'

    -- Reinforcement Learning
    prediction_accuracy_score DECIMAL(5, 2),  -- How accurate was this prediction?

    INDEX idx_predictions_symbol (symbol),
    INDEX idx_predictions_timestamp (timestamp),
    INDEX idx_predictions_outcome (outcome_evaluated, symbol)
);
```

### Prediction Storage Flow

1. **When LLM suggests entry**:
```python
await store_prediction({
    "conversation_id": conv_id,
    "symbol": "BYND",
    "prediction_type": "entry_suggestion",
    "direction": "long",
    "entry_price": 0.5670,
    "stop_loss": 0.5620,
    "take_profit": 0.5850,
    "patterns_detected": {
        "fvg": {"type": "bullish", "confidence": 8.5},
        "bos": {"type": "bullish", "confidence": 7.2}
    },
    "overall_confidence": 8.4,
    "price_at_prediction": 0.5685
})
```

2. **24-48 bars later (automated job)**:
```python
# Evaluate outcome
prediction = get_prediction(id)
bars_since = get_bars_since(prediction.timestamp, count=48)

# Calculate metrics
mfe = calculate_max_favorable_excursion(bars_since, prediction)
mae = calculate_max_adverse_excursion(bars_since, prediction)
hit_tp = check_if_hit_target(bars_since, prediction.take_profit)
hit_sl = check_if_hit_stop(bars_since, prediction.stop_loss)

# Determine outcome
if hit_tp and not hit_sl:
    outcome = "win"
    accuracy_score = 10.0
elif hit_sl:
    outcome = "loss"
    accuracy_score = 0.0
else:
    # Evaluate partial success based on MFE/MAE
    accuracy_score = calculate_partial_score(mfe, mae)

# Update prediction
update_prediction(id, {
    "outcome_evaluated": True,
    "mfe": mfe,
    "mae": mae,
    "actual_outcome": outcome,
    "prediction_accuracy_score": accuracy_score
})
```

## 5. Reinforcement Learning System

### Pattern Success Rate Calculation

```sql
-- Get FVG success rate
SELECT
    patterns_detected->>'fvg'->>'type' as fvg_type,
    AVG(prediction_accuracy_score) as avg_accuracy,
    COUNT(*) as sample_size,
    SUM(CASE WHEN actual_outcome = 'win' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::FLOAT / COUNT(*) as win_rate
FROM trade_predictions
WHERE patterns_detected ? 'fvg'
  AND outcome_evaluated = TRUE
GROUP BY fvg_type;
```

### Confidence Calibration

Compare predicted confidence vs actual outcomes:
```python
# If FVG confidence=8.5 but only 50% win rate ‚Üí recalibrate scoring
# Adjust confidence formula based on historical performance
```

### Learning Feedback Loop

1. **Weekly Analysis**:
   - Which patterns had highest win rate?
   - What confidence scores were most accurate?
   - Which market conditions produced best results?

2. **Auto-Adjust Scoring**:
   - If bearish FVGs underperform ‚Üí reduce their confidence by 10%
   - If BoS with high volume overperforms ‚Üí increase bonus

3. **Prompt Enhancement**:
   - Feed winning pattern characteristics back into system prompt
   - "Recent analysis shows bullish FVGs with >8.0 confidence have 75% success rate"

## 6. LLM Response Format with Scores

### Example: "What do you see?" Response
```
üìä BYND @ $0.5685 | Data: 150 bars (7.5/10 quality)

üéØ Bullish FVG at $0.5650-$0.5670 (12 bars ago)
   Confidence: 8.5/10 | Gap: 0.45% | Volume: ‚úì

üìà Bullish BoS at $0.5600 (18 bars ago)
   Confidence: 7.2/10 | Volume: Strong (1.6x)

‚úÖ Confluence Score: 9.2/10
   FVG + BoS alignment | High probability setup

üí° Suggested Entry: $0.5670 (FVG retest)
   Stop: $0.5620 | Target: $0.5850
   R:R = 1:3.6 | Win Probability: 70-75%

Overall Confidence: 8.4/10
```

### Low Data Warning
```
üìä BYND @ $0.5685 | Data: 45 bars (2.3/10 quality)
‚ö†Ô∏è Limited data (45min of history)

Detected: Possible bullish FVG at $0.5660
Confidence: 4.2/10 (LOW - insufficient history)

üí° Suggestion: Wait for more data or trade with reduced size.
   Risk is higher due to limited price action visibility.
```
