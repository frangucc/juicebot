# Murphy Momentum Trading Strategy
**Context:** Gap up stocks with bullish bias (JuiceBot strategy)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ THE ACTUAL STRATEGY

### What We Tested (WRONG):
```
âœ— Bidirectional swing trading over 7 days
âœ— Equal weight to longs and shorts
âœ— Hold until direction change or 50 bars
âœ— Scale out at fixed profit targets
```

### What You Actually Do (RIGHT):
```
âœ“ Scan for gap up stocks premarket
âœ“ Enter LONG biased on bullish days
âœ“ Ride momentum moves
âœ“ Cover on pullbacks (take profits)
âœ“ Don't reverse to short unless very strong signal
```

## ðŸ”„ EXECUTION ALGORITHM CHANGES

### 1. **Directional Bias System**

**Morning Scan Results:**
```python
session_bias = "BULLISH"  # From gap up scan
# OR
session_bias = "BEARISH"  # From gap down scan
# OR
session_bias = "NEUTRAL"  # Choppy day
```

**Signal Filtering Based on Bias:**

```python
if session_bias == "BULLISH":
    # LONG signals: More lenient
    if murphy_signal.direction == "â†‘":
        if murphy_signal.tier <= 2:  # Trade Tier 1-2 longs
            ENTER_LONG()
    
    # SHORT signals: Very strict
    if murphy_signal.direction == "â†“":
        if murphy_signal.tier == 1:  # ONLY Premium shorts
            if murphy_signal.rejection_type:  # Must have rejection
                ENTER_SHORT()  # Counter-trend short
        else:
            SKIP()  # Don't fight the trend
```

**Current Test (WRONG):** Treated all signals equally regardless of market bias.

---

### 2. **Entry Timing: Trade the Pullbacks**

**OLD (Bidirectional):**
```python
if murphy_signal.passes_filter():
    ENTER_IMMEDIATELY()
```

**NEW (Momentum):**
```python
if session_bias == "BULLISH":
    if murphy_signal.direction == "â†‘":
        # Wait for pullback entry on longs
        if is_pullback_complete():
            ENTER_LONG()  # Buy the dip
    else:
        SKIP()  # Don't short into strength
```

**Pullback Detection:**
```python
def is_pullback_complete():
    # Price pulled back from recent high
    recent_high = max(last_20_bars.high)
    current_price = bar.close
    pullback_pct = (recent_high - current_price) / recent_high
    
    # Murphy shows bullish signal at support
    if pullback_pct > 0.02:  # 2%+ pullback
        if murphy.direction == "â†‘":
            if murphy.rejection_type or murphy.pattern:
                return True  # Buy the dip!
    
    return False
```

---

### 3. **Exit on Momentum Loss (NOT Direction Change)**

**OLD (Bidirectional):**
```python
if murphy.direction_changed():
    EXIT_POSITION()  # Wait for opposite signal
```

**NEW (Momentum):**
```python
# Exit on FIRST SIGN of momentum loss
if detect_momentum_loss():
    EXIT_POSITION()  # Don't wait for reversal!

def detect_momentum_loss():
    # Momentum indicators
    if volume_declining_3_bars():
        return True
    
    if price_consolidating():  # Sideways for 5+ bars
        return True
    
    if broke_rising_trendline():
        return True
    
    # Murphy shows NEUTRAL or weak opposing signal
    if murphy.direction == "âˆ’":
        return True
    
    if murphy.direction == opposite_of_position():
        if murphy.tier <= 2:  # Strong opposing signal
            return True
    
    return False
```

**Key Difference:** Exit EARLY when momentum fades, don't wait for full reversal.

---

### 4. **Scale In on STRENGTH (Not on gain %)**

**OLD (Bidirectional):**
```python
# Scale in at +1%, +2% gain
if position_pnl >= 1.0%:
    ADD_TO_POSITION()
```

**NEW (Momentum):**
```python
# Scale in when momentum ACCELERATES
if momentum_accelerating():
    ADD_TO_POSITION()  # Add to winners!

def momentum_accelerating():
    # Volume increasing
    if current_volume > avg_volume * 1.5:
        # Price making new highs
        if current_high > highest_high_last_10_bars:
            # Murphy still bullish
            if murphy.direction == "â†‘":
                return True
    
    return False
```

**Example: BYND Oct 20**
```
Bar 736: +12% on huge volume â†’ ADD
Bar 737: +21% NEW HIGH      â†’ ADD AGAIN
Bar 738: Pullback -9%       â†’ HOLD (or partial exit)
```

---

### 5. **Scale Out on WEAKNESS (Not fixed targets)**

**OLD (Bidirectional):**
```python
# Take profits at +2%, +4%, +6%, +8%
if position_pnl >= 2.0%:
    EXIT_25%()
```

**NEW (Momentum):**
```python
# Take profits when momentum weakens
if first_sign_of_weakness():
    EXIT_30%()  # Lock in some gains

if momentum_clearly_fading():
    EXIT_50%()  # Take more off

if reversal_imminent():
    EXIT_100%()  # Get out!

def first_sign_of_weakness():
    # Volume drops below average
    if current_volume < avg_volume * 0.8:
        return True
    
    # Price fails to make new high
    if failed_breakout():
        return True
    
    # Murphy shows neutral
    if murphy.direction == "âˆ’":
        return True
    
    return False
```

---

### 6. **DON'T Reverse (Go Flat Instead)**

**OLD (Bidirectional):**
```python
if murphy_signal.direction != current_position.side:
    CLOSE_POSITION()
    REVERSE_TO_OPPOSITE_SIDE()  # Go short if was long
```

**NEW (Momentum):**
```python
if murphy_signal.direction != current_position.side:
    CLOSE_POSITION()
    GO_FLAT()  # Don't reverse!
    
    # Only re-enter if VERY strong signal in trend direction
    if session_bias == "BULLISH":
        # Wait for next long setup
        # Don't take shorts unless Premium + rejection
```

**Why?** On bullish gap up days, shorts are counter-trend and risky.

---

### 7. **Time-Based Rules**

```python
# Morning session (first 2 hours): Most momentum
if time_of_day() == "MORNING":
    TRADE_AGGRESSIVELY()
    scale_in_quickly = True
    let_winners_run = True

# Mid-day (lunch): Chop zone
elif time_of_day() == "MIDDAY":
    REDUCE_POSITION_SIZE()
    take_profits_early = True

# Power hour (last hour): Potential reversal
elif time_of_day() == "POWER_HOUR":
    BE_CAUTIOUS()
    tighten_stops = True
```

## ðŸ“Š EXAMPLE: BYND Oct 20 with NEW Strategy

### **OLD Strategy (Tested):**
```
Bar 736: Murphy â†‘ Tier 2 â†’ Enter long 40% @ $1.01
Bar 737: Price +21% â†’ Add 30% @ $1.23
Bar 738: Price -9% â†’ Hold (waiting for direction change)
Bar 740: Murphy â†“ Tier 2 â†’ EXIT long, REVERSE to short @ $1.10
Result: Gave back all gains, then lost on short
```

### **NEW Strategy (Momentum):**
```
Pre-market: BYND gaps up +23% â†’ session_bias = "BULLISH"

Bar 736: Murphy â†‘ Tier 2 + volume spike
  â†’ Enter 40% @ $1.01 (pullback from $1.02 high)

Bar 737: New high $1.24, volume 2x avg, Murphy still â†‘
  â†’ Add 30% @ $1.10 (on dip from $1.24)
  â†’ Add 30% @ $1.20 (breakout)
  â†’ Now 100% in

Bar 738: Volume drops, price pulls back to $1.11
  â†’ First sign of weakness
  â†’ EXIT 30% @ $1.15 (lock in gains)

Bar 739-741: Consolidation, volume declining
  â†’ Momentum fading
  â†’ EXIT 50% @ $1.08

Bar 742: Murphy shows neutral "âˆ’"
  â†’ EXIT 20% @ $1.06 (nearly flat)
  
Result: Caught the run from $0.90-$1.24, scaled out $1.15-$1.06
        Avg exit $1.10 â†’ +22% gain vs +10% open
```

## ðŸŽ¯ UPDATED RISK MODES

### **Momentum-Aware Risk Modes:**

**LOW RISK (Conservative):**
- Trade ONLY Tier 1 signals IN TREND DIRECTION
- Quick profit taking (exit 50% at first weakness)
- No counter-trend trades
- Morning session only

**MEDIUM RISK (Balanced):**
- Trade Tier 1-2 signals WITH trend bias
- Standard profit taking (30/50/20)
- Premium counter-trend trades only
- Morning + early afternoon

**HIGH RISK (Aggressive):**
- Trade Tier 1-2 WITH trend, Tier 3 OK if strong
- Let winners run (hold through small pullbacks)
- Counter-trend trades if Tier 1 + rejection
- Full day trading

---

## ðŸ”§ CODE CHANGES NEEDED

### 1. Add Session Bias Parameter:
```python
class TradingSimulatorV3:
    def __init__(self, session_bias="NEUTRAL"):
        self.session_bias = session_bias  # BULLISH, BEARISH, NEUTRAL
```

### 2. Bias-Aware Signal Filtering:
```python
def should_enter(self, signal):
    # Check trend alignment
    if self.session_bias == "BULLISH":
        if signal.direction == "â†“":
            if signal.tier != 1 or not signal.rejection_type:
                return False  # Skip weak shorts on bullish day
    
    # Same for bearish days...
```

### 3. Momentum Exit Logic:
```python
def check_momentum_exit(self, bar_index, bars):
    # Check volume
    recent_volume = [b.volume for b in bars[-5:]]
    if bars[-1].volume < statistics.mean(recent_volume) * 0.8:
        return True, "volume_declining"
    
    # Check price action
    if self.is_consolidating(bars[-10:]):
        return True, "momentum_fading"
    
    return False, None
```

### 4. Re-Entry on Pullbacks:
```python
def check_pullback_reentry(self, signal, bars):
    if not self.position and signal.direction_matches_bias():
        if self.is_pullback_to_support(bars):
            if signal.tier <= 2:
                return True
    return False
```

## ðŸ’¡ WHY THIS MATTERS

**Your Current Test Results:**
- Tested bidirectional over 7 days
- Lost -1.85% to -4.12%
- Win rate 24-30%

**What Should Have Been Tested:**
- Only LONG trades on Oct 20 (gap up day)
- Exit on momentum loss (not direction change)
- Don't reverse to short

**Expected Results with Momentum Strategy:**
- Catch the +37% morning run
- Exit around +20-30% avg
- Maybe 1-3 trades total that day
- Likely PROFITABLE

---

## ðŸš€ NEXT STEPS

1. **Re-run test with session bias:**
```bash
python murphy_regression_test_v3.py --bias bullish --date 2025-10-20
```

2. **Test ONLY gap up days:**
Filter dataset to days with >5% gap up

3. **Measure differently:**
- Success = catching 50%+ of the run
- Not: bidirectional win rate over weeks

---

**THE BOTTOM LINE:**
We built a Ferrari and tested it like a tractor. Murphy might be GREAT at momentum trading but TERRIBLE at bidirectional swing trading. We need to test the RIGHT strategy!
