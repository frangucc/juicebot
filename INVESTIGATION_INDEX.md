## Key Concepts

### The Core Issue
- **What:** Master P&L shows $0.00 after position closes
- **Why:** Not retrieved from database
- **Where:** `get_pnl_summary()` function
- **How to fix:** Query closed trades for P&L

### The Root Cause
- **Not data loss** (data is in database)
- **Data retrieval gap** (no query for closed positions)
- **Design disconnect** (system queries only status='open')

### The Fix
- **2 changes:** Add 1 method + update 1 method
- **15 minutes:** Implementation time
- **0 breaking changes:** Backward compatible

---

## Quick Reference

### Problem Summary
```
OPEN position: P&L shown ✓
SCALEOUT with partial exits: P&L shown ✓
CLOSE position: P&L shows $0.00 ✗ (should show $160.00)
```

### Root Cause
```
Position closed:     status='closed', realized_pnl=$160.00 ✓ (stored)
Query for P&L:       Looks for status='open' only ✗ (not retrieved)
Fallback:            Hardcoded $0.00 ✗
```

### Solution
```
Query closed trades: SELECT WHERE status='closed'
Sum their P&L:       AGGREGATE realized_pnl
Return to user:      $160.00 ✓
```
