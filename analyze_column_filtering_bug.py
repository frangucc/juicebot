"""
Analyze the column filtering bug in the leaderboard.

THE BUG:
- Backend API fetches symbols based on % YEST (by default)
- Columns are populated based on % YEST ranges: 20%+, 10-20%, 1-10%
- Frontend just sorts/displays those pre-populated columns
- When user switches from "% YEST" to "% OPEN", the COLUMNS DON'T CHANGE
- Frontend just sorts the same symbols by % OPEN instead of % YEST
- Result: Symbols that are 20%+ from YEST but only 5% from OPEN stay in the 20%+ column

WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:
- When user switches baseline, the columns should RE-CATEGORIZE based on that baseline
- A symbol with % YEST = +25%, % OPEN = +5% should:
  - Be in "20%+" column when viewing % YEST
  - Move to "1-10%" column when viewing % OPEN
