# Murphy Regression Test V2 - FINAL RESULTS
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Test:** Proper trading logic with stop losses, scale in/out, risk management

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### **Even with PROPER trading logic, Murphy is still LOSING money on BYND**

| Risk Mode | Trades | Win Rate | P&L | Drawdown |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----|----------|
| **Low (Conservative)** | 268 | 24.3% | **-1.85%** | 2.71% |
| **Medium (Balanced)** | 264 | 25.8% | **-4.12%** | 5.62% |
| **High (Aggressive)** | 962 | 29.5% | **-3.23%** | 10.67% |

---

## 📊 WHAT WE LEARNED

### 1. **ONLY Trading Tier 1 (Premium) Signals Helps**
Low & Medium risk modes ONLY traded Premium signals (rejections + patterns):
- Traded: 268 signals out of 5,332 generated (5%)
- Accuracy @ 20 bars: **47.9%** for Tier 1
- BUT: Still lost money (-1.85% and -4.12%)

### 2. **Adding Tier 2 (Strong) Makes Things WORSE**
High risk mode traded Tier 1 + Tier 2 (1,675 signals = 31%):
- More trades (962 vs 268)
- Slightly better win rate (29.5% vs 24-26%)
- But WORSE drawdown (10.67% vs 2.71%)

### 3. **Win Rate is TERRIBLE Across All Modes**
- Low: 24.3% wins
- Medium: 25.8% wins
- High: 29.5% wins

**Problem:** Need 40%+ win rate minimum to be profitable with proper risk management!

### 4. **Stop Losses ARE Working**
Compared to V1 test (no stops):
- V1: -5.15% with largest loss -42%
- V2 Low: -1.85% with max drawdown 2.71%
- **Stops saved ~3.3%!**

### 5. **Scale Out IS Working**
- Avg win: $127-$204
- Avg loss: $-50 to $-92
- Win/loss ratio improved (but not enough)

### 6. **Murphy's Accuracy Is The Bottleneck**
Even with perfect execution:
- Tier 1: 47.9% accuracy (below 50%)
- Tier 2: 43.6% accuracy
- Tier 3: 42.4% accuracy

## 💡 WHY IS MURPHY LOSING?

### Problem 1: Signal Accuracy Too Low
47.9% accuracy for BEST signals is below random (50%)

### Problem 2: BYND Might Be A Bad Fit
User reported Murphy running at **56% live** on multiple symbols.
Regression test shows **47.9% on BYND** for premium signals.

**Hypothesis:** BYND's price action doesn't fit SMC concepts well.

### Problem 3: Win Rate Too Low
Even with 2:1 reward/risk ratio, need ~40% win rate.
Current: 24-30% win rate.

**Missing piece:** Need higher quality signal generation OR better symbols.

## 🎯 COMPARISON: V1 vs V2

| Metric | V1 (Bad Logic) | V2 Low | V2 Med | V2 High |
|--------|----------------|--------|---------|---------|
| Trades | 1,637 | 268 | 264 | 962 |
| Win Rate | 35.6% | 24.3% | 25.8% | 29.5% |
| P&L | -5.15% | -1.85% | -4.12% | -3.23% |
| Max Loss | -42% | -1.5% stop | -2% stop | -2.5% stop |
| Drawdown | 14.08% | 2.71% | 5.62% | 10.67% |

**Key Insight:** V2 Low risk reduced loss from -5.15% → -1.85% (+3.3% improvement!)

## 🚀 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:

**1. Test Murphy on Different Symbols**
```bash
# Test on symbols that work better with SMC
python murphy_regression_test_v2.py --symbol SPY --risk low
python murphy_regression_test_v2.py --symbol TSLA --risk low
python murphy_regression_test_v2.py --symbol QQQ --risk low
```

**2. DON'T Deploy To Live Trading Yet**
- Murphy needs 50%+ accuracy minimum
- Current: 47.9% for best signals
- Wait for better symbols or classifier improvements

**3. Focus on Murphy Classifier Tuning**
The execution logic is SOLID. The problem is signal quality.

Priority improvements:
- Adjust V2 feature detection thresholds
- Add more confluence requirements
- Test on trending vs choppy markets separately
- Consider adding volume profile analysis

**4. Use V2 Test Framework For Validation**
Every Murphy improvement should be tested with:
```bash
python murphy_regression_test_v2.py --all
```

## 📈 WHAT'S WORKING

### ✅ V2 Features ARE Improving Accuracy
- Rejections: 48.6% (vs 36% baseline) = +12.6%
- Patterns: 44.1% (vs 36% baseline) = +8.1%
- V2 features ARE valuable!

### ✅ Risk Management IS Working
- Stop losses cap catastrophic losses
- Scale out locks in profits
- Drawdown controlled (2.71% low risk vs 14% V1)

### ✅ Tier System Makes Sense
- Tier 1: 47.9% (premium signals)
- Tier 2: 43.6% (strong)
- Tier 3: 42.4% (standard)
- Tier 4: 21.5% (skip)

**Clear hierarchy exists!**

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1B: Symbol Analysis (RECOMMENDED)
Test Murphy on 10+ symbols to find where it performs best:
- Trending stocks (TSLA, NVDA)
- Index ETFs (SPY, QQQ)
- Volatile stocks (GME, AMC)
- Compare results

### Phase 2: Classifier Improvements (If needed)
If Murphy underperforms on ALL symbols:
- Stricter V2 feature requirements
- Add order flow analysis
- Multi-timeframe confluence
- Market regime detection (trending vs choppy)

### Phase 3: Deploy ONLY When Ready
Requirements for live deployment:
- 50%+ accuracy on premium signals
- 40%+ win rate in trading simulation
- Positive P&L on 3+ symbols
- Max drawdown <5%

## 💬 USER FEEDBACK VALIDATION

**User said:** "murphy widget is getting good running at 56%"

**Our findings:**
- BYND premium signals: 47.9%
- But user tests multiple symbols live
- **Conclusion:** BYND might not be Murphy's best symbol!

**Action:** Test Murphy on symbols user is seeing 56% on.

## 🏆 BOTTOM LINE

**Good News:**
1. ✅ V2 features work and improve accuracy
2. ✅ Execution logic is solid (stops, scale in/out)
3. ✅ Tier system correctly identifies premium signals
4. ✅ Test framework is comprehensive and reusable

**Bad News:**
1. ❌ Murphy loses money on BYND even with perfect execution
2. ❌ Signal accuracy (47.9%) below profitable threshold (50%)
3. ❌ Win rate (24-30%) too low

**The Verdict:**
Murphy has a solid foundation but needs either:
- Better symbols (test others!)
- OR better classifier tuning

**DO NOT deploy to live trading until:**
- 50%+ accuracy achieved
- Tested positive on 3+ symbols
- Win rate 40%+
