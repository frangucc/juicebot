# Prisma Setup Note

## Decision: Skip Prisma for Phase 1

We hit a Prisma caching/config issue that's wasting time. For Phase 1 MVP, we'll stick with direct SQL (already working with Supabase client).

**Why:**
- Getting Prisma working is taking too long
- Direct SQL + Supabase client already works
- We can add Prisma properly in Phase 2 when we have more time
- Focus on getting the screener working first

## What to do for Phase 1:

1. Run `sql/001_init_schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (manual, one-time)
2. Use Supabase Python client (already working)
3. Everything else continues as planned

## What to do in Phase 2:

1. Clean Prisma installation
2. Proper schema with migrations
3. TypeScript types generated
4. Better developer experience

## Current Status:

- ✅ Database schema designed (in SQL)
- ✅ Supabase client working
- ✅ Python screener working
- ✅ API working
- ✅ Dashboard working
- ⏸️ Prisma - postponed to Phase 2

**Bottom line:** The app works without Prisma. We'll add it properly later when we're not rushing the MVP.
