# Murphy Test System - Fixed & Working

## What Changed

### ✅ Fixed Issues:

1. **Auto-Recording**: Test sessions now auto-create when you start Murphy Live
2. **No Manual Button**: Removed "START TEST SESSION" button - everything happens automatically
3. **Graceful Failures**: Murphy Live works even if test system isn't set up
4. **Warm-up Messaging**: Clear communication about the ~20 bar warm-up period

## How It Works Now

### Starting Murphy Live

```
You: murphy live
```

**What Happens:**
1. ✅ Murphy Live worker starts
2. ✅ Test session auto-creates (or reuses existing one)
3. ✅ Widget accuracy tracking begins immediately
4. ✅ All signals (filtered + displayed) recorded to database
5. ✅ Evaluator runs in background, checking signals every 10 seconds

**Console Output:**
```
[Murphy Live] Started for BYND
[Murphy Live] Auto-created test session abc12345...
```

### Widget Accuracy Tracking

**Top right of Murphy widget:**
- Shows "Last Signal: PENDING" until first evaluation completes (2 min)
- Shows "Accuracy: NO DATA" until signals are evaluated
- Updates every 10 seconds automatically

**Timeline:**
- **0-20 bars**: Warm-up period, no signals yet
- **20+ bars**: Signals start appearing
- **2 min after signal**: First evaluation (2min check)
- **5 min after signal**: Second evaluation
- **10 min after signal**: Third evaluation
- **30 min after signal**: FINAL evaluation, marks correct/wrong

### Test Lab Modal

**Click the flask icon (🧪) in Murphy widget:**

**No Setup Required:**
- Opens automatically
- Shows auto-created session
- Displays all signals as they're recorded
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds

**What You See:**
- **Metrics Panel**: Total signals, displayed/filtered counts, accuracy stats
- **Signals Table**: Every signal with multi-timeframe evaluation
- **View Tabs**: All / Displayed / Filtered

**Empty State Messages:**
- If no Murphy Live: "Type 'murphy live' in chat..."
- If Murphy Live but no signals: "Warming up... ~20 bars needed"

## Warm-up Period Explained

### Why 20 bars?

Murphy classifier needs historical context to:
- Calculate RVOL (relative volume) - needs 20 bar average
- Detect patterns (three soldiers, three crows) - needs 3+ bars
- Analyze FVGs (Fair Value Gaps) - needs gap formation across multiple bars
- Calculate ATR (Average True Range) - needs 14+ bars

### What Happens During Warm-up:

**Bars 1-19:**
```
[Murphy Live] Started for BYND
[Murphy Live] Bar data: 15 bars (need 20 minimum)
```

**Bar 20+:**
```
[Murphy Live] ✓ PUBLISH: initial signal
MURPHY LIVE | Direction: ↓ BEARISH | Strength: WEAK **
```

Widget appears and starts showing signals!

## Test System Architecture

```
Murphy Live Worker (every 1 second)
    ↓
Generate Murphy Signal
    ↓
Apply Filters (stars >= 3, grade >= 7, etc.)
    ↓
Record to Database (ALL signals, filtered + displayed)
    ↓
[If passed filter] → Publish to widget
    ↓
Background Evaluator (every 10 seconds)
    ↓
Evaluate signals at 2min, 5min, 10min, 30min
    ↓
Update accuracy metrics
```

## Database Schema Applied

If you want full test recording functionality, apply schema:

```sql
-- Supabase SQL Editor → Run this:
-- Copy contents of: database/murphy_test_schema.sql
```

**Without schema applied:**
- Murphy Live still works!
- Widget accuracy tracking still works!
- Test Lab won't have data
- Console shows: "Test recording disabled: [error]"

**With schema applied:**
- Everything works
- Test Lab shows full historical data
- Can compare sessions over time

## Troubleshooting

### Widget Shows "PENDING" Forever

**Cause:** No signals being published (stuck in warm-up or all filtered)

**Check:**
1. How many bars? Need 20+ minimum
2. Console logs: Look for `[Murphy Live] ✓ PUBLISH` or `[Murphy Live] ✗ SKIP`
3. Are all signals being filtered? Check grades/stars

**Fix:**
- Wait for more bars to accumulate
- If 50+ bars and still no signals, filters may be too strict

### Test Lab Empty

**Cause:** Database schema not applied OR no signals generated yet

**Check:**
1. Console shows: `[Murphy Test] Recorded signal...`?
2. If yes: Schema applied, just waiting for warm-up
3. If no: Schema not applied, recording disabled

**Fix:**
- If schema issue: Apply `database/murphy_test_schema.sql`
- If warm-up: Wait for 20+ bars
- Murphy Live still works either way!

### Signals Not Being Evaluated

**Cause:** Evaluator not running OR signals too recent

**Check:**
1. Console shows: `[Murphy Evaluator] Starting background evaluator...`?
2. Are signals at least 2 minutes old?

**Fix:**
- Restart services: `npm stop && npm start`
- Wait 2+ minutes after first signal

## Current Filter Settings

Located in: `ai-service/fast_classifier_v2.py` (lines 267-271)

```python
is_significant = (
    signal.stars >= 3 or           # High star rating
    signal.grade >= 7 or           # High quality grade
    abs(signal.confidence) >= 1.0  # High confidence
)
```

**Plus sticky logic:**
- First signal: Always show
- Same direction: Only if stronger (higher grade/stars)
- Direction flip: Only if high conviction (grade >= 7 OR stars >= 3)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Restart services: `npm stop && npm start`
2. ✅ Navigate to chart-agent for any symbol
3. ✅ Type "murphy live" in chat
4. ✅ Wait for warm-up (~20 bars, ~20 seconds)
5. ✅ Watch signals appear in widget
6. ✅ Click flask icon to see Test Lab
7. ⏳ Let run for 1-2 hours to collect meaningful data
8. ⏳ Analyze results and optimize filters

## Key Improvements

**Before:**
- ❌ Had to click "START TEST SESSION" manually
- ❌ No indication of warm-up period
- ❌ Unclear if recording was working
- ❌ Test system could break Murphy Live

**After:**
- ✅ Everything auto-starts with Murphy Live
- ✅ Clear messaging about warm-up
- ✅ Console logs show recording status
- ✅ Murphy Live works even if test system fails
- ✅ Widget and Test Lab work independently

## Success Metrics

After 2+ hours of running:

**Good Setup (What to aim for):**
```
Total Signals: 87
Displayed: 23 (26%)
Filtered: 64 (74%)

Displayed Accuracy: 69.6%
Filtered Accuracy: 51.6%
```

This means filters are working - showing mostly good signals, hiding mostly noise!
